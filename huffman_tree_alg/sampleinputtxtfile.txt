I remember a time when I was short.
Made a gwala and had a bang in the benihana
A couple of lamas, a lot of parmesan
Young susano, I uchicha after zan.
Everything's going according to plan, on the bat Montana
# Bandana head, the gang don't need no guards
♪ stripes on me, oh yeah, I started running early ♪
# Fuck the wallets, the stack's sticking out of my pocket #
Yeah we smoke lala, yeah we smoke zaza
Yeah, we're smoking shaba and our eyes are pussy from the gas
# Mischa ate the Xanax, Mischa after the bars #
Mischa after the bars, hear Mischa after the bars
And I got the gang on me, the gang?
What's in my glass, it's not just Fanta!
She's such a sucker for a talent show.
But she and I don't get it after a couple of blunts.
Bitch, you ain't my partner.
I had a white guy at the last desk.
Yeah, I'm the white one who made it Mama
Everything's going according to plan, it's a bandana
I remember when there was no Lego
Now they want to sit on Oleg's dick
All I do is fuego
# They don't turn this guy on, moola's boosting my ego #
The streets don't sleep I'm a soldier it's a bandana
My bush on the left and bricks on the right
Muscle on the pack there's press on the pockets
That's not what you're talking about white man can't understand okay.
Lots of snow even in the middle of summer
Their rap ain't even worth my bracelet
Quepasa, tequiero. Gualito, dinero.
Mas uno numero, I'm about queso is cheddar
A lot of gossip but I don't give a fuck about it
Moola first and also second
